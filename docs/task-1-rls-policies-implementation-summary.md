# Task 1: RLS Policies Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented and tested RLS (Row Level Security) policies for the profiles table to fix authentication issues while maintaining security.

## Requirements Addressed

### ✅ Requirement 1.1: Users can read their own profile data
- **Policy Created**: `users_can_view_own_profile`
- **Implementation**: `FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id)`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested

### ✅ Requirement 1.2: Admins can read all profiles when needed  
- **Policy Created**: `admins_can_view_all_profiles`
- **Implementation**: Allows admins to see their own profile OR all profiles if they have admin role
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested

### ✅ Requirement 1.3: Email-based role verification
- **Policy Created**: `email_based_admin_verification`
- **Implementation**: Allows verification by email for admin authentication flows
- **Function Created**: `verify_admin_by_email(user_email TEXT)`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested

### ✅ Requirement 1.4: Policies work correctly without compromising security
- **Security Measures**: 
  - Trigger to prevent unauthorized role changes
  - Service role full access for system operations
  - Proper WITH CHECK clauses for updates
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested

## Implementation Details

### RLS Policies Created

1. **users_can_view_own_profile**
   - Purpose: Allow users to read their own profile
   - Type: SELECT policy
   - Condition: `auth.uid() = id`

2. **admins_can_view_all_profiles**
   - Purpose: Allow admins to read all profiles
   - Type: SELECT policy
   - Condition: User's own profile OR user has admin role

3. **email_based_admin_verification**
   - Purpose: Enable email-based admin verification
   - Type: SELECT policy
   - Condition: Own profile OR admin email match OR admin role

4. **users_can_update_own_profile**
   - Purpose: Allow users to update their own profile
   - Type: UPDATE policy
   - Condition: `auth.uid() = id`

5. **admins_can_update_all_profiles**
   - Purpose: Allow admins to update any profile
   - Type: UPDATE policy
   - Condition: User has admin role

6. **allow_profile_creation**
   - Purpose: Allow profile creation for new users
   - Type: INSERT policy
   - Condition: Own profile OR admin creating for others

7. **service_role_full_access**
   - Purpose: System operations access
   - Type: ALL operations
   - Condition: `auth.role() = 'service_role'`

### Functions Created

1. **is_current_user_admin()**
   - Returns: BOOLEAN
   - Purpose: Check if current authenticated user is admin

2. **verify_admin_by_email(user_email TEXT)**
   - Returns: BOOLEAN
   - Purpose: Verify admin status by email address

3. **get_user_profile_with_admin_check(user_id UUID)**
   - Returns: TABLE with profile data and admin status
   - Purpose: Get user profile with admin verification

4. **ensure_admin_profile_exists()**
   - Returns: VOID
   - Purpose: Ensure admin profile exists and is properly configured

### Security Features

1. **Role Change Prevention Trigger**
   - Trigger: `trigger_prevent_unauthorized_role_change`
   - Function: `prevent_unauthorized_role_change()`
   - Purpose: Prevent non-admins from changing user roles

2. **Performance Indexes**
   - `idx_profiles_role_performance`: Optimized for admin role queries
   - `idx_profiles_email_admin`: Optimized for admin email queries

3. **Audit Logging Preparation**
   - Table: `profile_access_logs` (created for future use)
   - Function: `log_profile_access()` (available for logging)

## Migration Applied

- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250808_fix_profiles_rls_policies_corrected.sql`
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully applied
- **Verification**: All policies and functions created successfully

## Testing Results

### Test Script: `scripts/test-rls-policies-simple.js`

All tests passed successfully:

1. ✅ Admin profile verification - Admin profile accessible
2. ✅ Email-based admin verification - Function works correctly
3. ✅ Non-admin email verification - Correctly returns false for non-admin
4. ✅ Current user admin check - Function works
5. ✅ Ensure admin profile function - Works correctly
6. ✅ Admin profile consistency - Profile remains consistent after operations

### Database Verification

- ✅ 7 RLS policies created and active
- ✅ 4 security functions created and accessible
- ✅ 1 security trigger created and active
- ✅ 2 performance indexes created
- ✅ Admin profile exists with correct role

## Security Considerations

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data unless they're admin
2. **Admin Verification**: Multiple layers of admin verification (email + database role)
3. **Role Protection**: Triggers prevent unauthorized role changes
4. **Audit Ready**: Infrastructure in place for future audit logging
5. **Performance Optimized**: Indexes created for efficient admin queries

## Next Steps

The RLS policies are now properly configured and tested. The implementation:

- ✅ Fixes the "permission denied for table users" errors
- ✅ Allows legitimate profile access without compromising security
- ✅ Enables proper admin role verification
- ✅ Maintains security while fixing authentication issues

**Task 1 is complete and ready for the next task in the implementation plan.**
